               <p>In this project we implemented the mediaelement.js library,
               embedded 2 video formats using HTML, added transcript using HTML tags,
               and used a mobile first approach. When the user clicks on any sentence
               in the transcript the video player jumps to the appropriate time in the video. I also
               customized the media player skin and used CSS pre-processor SASS.</p>
